# Sai-Meghna-Dance-School

This is a custom-built full-stack website created for my mom's Kuchipudi dance school using the MERN stack. The frontend was developed in React and styled with Tailwind CSS, enhanced by animations from Framer Motion and AOS. It includes features like a testimonial carousel, dynamic routing, and a floating chat modal. On the backend, Express and MongoDB handle form submissions and data management. The site is fully mobile-responsive and branded with Indian cultural motifs to reflect the school's identity.
