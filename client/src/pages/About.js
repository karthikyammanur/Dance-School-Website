          <p className="text-lg text-charcoal/80 max-w-4xl mx-auto leading-relaxed">
            Kuchipudi is a classical dance which was originated in the 12th century in Kuchipudi village of Andhra Pradesh. 
            This splendid dance form is profoundly aesthetic and the experience of watching it is most exhilarating. 
            Strictly adhering to the rules laid down in Bharata's Natya Shastra (science of Dancing) and Nandikeshwara's 
            Abhinaya Darpam (mirror of expression), Kuchipudi has all the salient features of a classical dance. All it's 
            compositions are set to Carnatic music and the songs are written in Telugu language. Kuchipudi is a perfect 
            balance between 3 aspects â€“ Nritta, Nritya and Naatya each being equivalent in nature. The Nritta is a rhythmic 
            sequence that concludes a song or averse, the Nritya is where the rhythmic passages are followed by interpretation 
            and Naatya is a complete dance drama with various characters and a story line. The charm of Kuchipudi lies in its 
            graceful movements, intricate footwork, complicated rhythmic patterns and the rapid tempo and thus distinguishes 
            it from the other dance forms.
